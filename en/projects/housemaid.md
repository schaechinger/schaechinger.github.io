# Housemaid

Housemaid is in a very early stage and has just the one feature that it was planned for originally: displaying missed phone calls.

The reason for the project was an error that did not allow my phone to display missed calls from my router. The software runs on a Raspberry Ï€ and crawls for new calls from the router. After an initial request of all missed calls so far it shows every new call with number and date on a small 20x2 LCD display.

I am currently working on a module system that integrates the missed call module. The system is controlled with a Leap Motion controller that can handle a various number of different modules with a wide area of features.

One can switch the current module with a single swipe gesture, navigate from page to page within the current module and even execute atomic actions.

The following modules are in development or planned right now:

* Managing devices in the wifi network
* Guest wifi that grants access through the MAC address and Facebook
* Subway timetables
* Weather forecast
* Heating control
* Contact information from the cloud
* Calendar events for today
