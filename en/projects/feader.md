# feader

feader was the topic of my bachelor thesis and is uploaded in a light version on
GitHub. The project resulted in a feed reader for rss and atom feeds that launched
after the end of the Google Reader.

In contrast to compeet agains alternatives with privacy protection of german law
and a clean and modern design.

The project was my first one written in PHP and was a good experiment. After short
period of time a few students noticed feader and after just one week the service
served articles for 100 users.

The platform based on the Zend Framework used a MySQL database and a crawler written
in C++ to update the feeds.

Between the end of my bachelor thesis and the start of my first job as a fulltime
developer the project gained too much time without creating a sort of premium model
so I decided to publish the project on GitHub.
